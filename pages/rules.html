                <h1>THE GOAL</h1>
                <p>
                    In the wake of the emergence of trimesters, none were more heartbroken than the faculties of UNSW. Faculties throughout the university sought to attain the most grants for their schools to help ease the transition to trimesters and bring joy to their staff. 
                    You are one of these faculties, trying to get money for your schools. Unfortunately, the university is only willing to give their money to one faculty at a time, so you must rely on your employees to secure the grants. 

                    During the game, you hold one secret card in your hand. This is who currently carries your business proposal for the university.

                    Make sure that the person closest to the chancellor holds your proposal at the end of the day, so it reaches him first!

            <h1>GAME PLAY</h1>
            <p>
                Grant Hunt is played in a series of rounds. Each round represents one day. At the end of each round, one player's proposal reaches the Chancellor, and he reads it.
                When he reads enough proposals from one faculty, he becomes enamored and grants that faculty permission the grant. That player wins the grant and the game.
            </p>    
            <h1>TAKING A TURN</h1>
            <p>
                On your turn, you will be given a card the top card from the deck and add it to your hand. Then, choose one of the two cards in your hand and discard it to play the card. Apply any effect on the card you discarded. You must apply its effect, even if it is bad for you.
                History is shown on the side of the screen with the last 10 plays. This helps players to figure out which cards other players might be holding.

                Once you finish applying the card's effect, the turn passes to the next player.
            </p>
            <h1>OUT OF THE ROUND</h1>
            <p>
                If a player is knocked out of the round, that player discards the card in his or her hand face up (do not apply the card's effect) and takes no more turns until next round.
            </p>
            <h1>HONESTY</h1>
            <p>
                A player could cheat when chosen with the Built Environment, or fail to discard the Engineering card when that player has the Science or Business cards in hand. We suggest that you don't play with knaves who cheat at fun, light games.</p>
            </p>
            <h1>END OF A ROUND</h1>
            <p>
                A round ends if the deck is empty at the end of a turn. The Chancellor's office closes for the evening, the person closest to the Chancellor delivers the proposal, and the Chancellor retires home to read it.

                All players still in the round reveal their hands. The player with the highest ranked faculty wins the round. In case of a tie, the player who discarded their highest total value of cards wins.

                A round also ends if all players but one are out of the round, in which case the remaining player wins.

                The winner receives a grant. Cards are shuffled and users play a new round following all of the setup rules.

                The winner of the previous round goes first, because the Chancellor speaks kindly of him or her.

            <h1>END OF A GAME</h1>
            <p style="width: 100%">
                A player wins the game after winning a number of tokens based on the number of players:
                <ul>
                    <li>2 Players: 7 tokens</li>
                    <li>3 Players: 5 tokens</li>
                    <li>4 players: 4 tokens</li>
                </ul>
